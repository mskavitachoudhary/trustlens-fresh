Email scanner regression matrix (A-L).

Runnable without pytest:

    python tests/test_email_scanner.py            # run all checks
    python tests/test_email_scanner.py --table    # just print the result table

The matrix uses *band* expectations (0-20 very low, 21-40 low, 41-60 suspicious,
61-80 high, 81-100 very high) plus relative ordering constraints. It never pins
exact scores, so the tests stay meaningful when weights evolve and they do not
over-fit to the samples.

Each sample is a realistic email that also documents WHY the expected band is
justified from its evidence - the scanner must reproduce that reasoning.
